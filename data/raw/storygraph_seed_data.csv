And it is so short that even if you are not reading a lot every day, you'll finish it in no time. <br><br>His style fits the narrative in such a way that I don't believe I had ever seen. The way in which he paints the picture that is Santiago's journey is so brilliant you could read this book just for that. But by the end you have such deep connection with Santiago that every little plot twist has emotional payoff.","",,"",No

Specially the whole notion of ""official truth"" that has always fascinated me and it is further explored in this book. Even though I wish there was more secondary characters (although solitude is central to this book) and wanted a main character that I could ""root for"" I enjoyed it very much and recommend it.","",,"",No
